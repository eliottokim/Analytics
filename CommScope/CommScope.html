            <h2>Business Overview</h2>
            <p>CommScope Holding Company, Inc. (CommScope) offers infrastructure solutions for communication networks across four segments: Connectivity and Cable Solutions (CCS), Outdoor Wireless Networks (OWN), Networking, Intelligent Cellular and Security Solutions (NICS), and Access Network Solutions (ANS). The company’s product portfolio includes antennas, broadband and access network systems, broadband and video devices, cabinets, panels, enclosures, cables, connectors, and enterprise networking. It offers services such as data center and fiber services, managed networks, network transformation, software and integration, and video services. Major brands include Andrew, Systimax, and Ruckus, among others. CommScope is headquartered globally in Hickory, North Carolina, with facilities across key regions, including the Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific.</p>
            <p>Since 2019, CommScope has faced ongoing financial challenges marked by consecutive negative net income margins and substantial loss on shareholders’ equity, primarily due to significant capital impairments and extensive indebtedness aggravated by its acquisition-driven growth strategy. In response, the company initiated the restructuring plan of the CommScope NEXT initiative in 2021, which aims to deliver enhanced shareholder value by improving the EBITDA multiple by increasing operational efficiency and reducing significant indebtedness. This strategy included the disjunction of its Home Network segment. Although besides a minor improvement in its operations cash flow, the company has not yet seen any significant progress since the initiative took its place.</p>

            <h2>Capital Structure</h2>
            <p>CommScope Holding Company, Inc., on a GAAP basis, reported a net loss for 2023 of $1,451 mm compared with a net loss of $1,287 mm in the previous year. Operating Profit reported at $(113) mm, and EBITDA reported at $1,080 mm. Cashflow from operations of $290 mm, cashflow from investing of $38 mm, and cash flow from financing of $(182) mm. Free cash flow of $237 mm, showcasing a positive double-digit growth compared to its previous year of $88.7 mm. Lastly, total assets of $9,372 mm, total equity of $(1,807) mm, and total liability of $11,179 mm.</p>
            <p>The firm has a total debt of $10,509 mm with a 6% weighted average applied interest rate and is facing near-term maturities of $1,297 mm within the next two years. It's worth noting that the company's long-term debt will mature by September 2029. Based on the reported amounts, Total Debt-to-EBITDA of 9.7x multiple, Net Debt-to-EBITDA of 9.2x multiple, Net Debt-to-Total Capitalization of 1.3x multiple, and Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) of 1.6x multiple.</p>

            <h2>Investment Thesis</h2>
            <p>CommScope Holding Company, Inc. faces potential challenges regarding its creditworthiness that require further assessment. The firm’s current level of debt has exceeded its total capitalization, as shown by the Net Debt-to-Total Capitalization ratio. Both Net Debt-to-EBITDA and Total Debt-to-EBITDA are greater than 5x multiple, highlighting the firm’s high level of debt and potential solvency risk. While the firm can currently meet its credit compliance, as indicated by ICR, the presence of near-term debt maturities coupled with the higher interest rates associated with refinancing activities suggests that a cautious approach is prudent.</p>
            <p>Currently, the company has not shown any significant signs of recovery. There has been a consecutive decline in profitability and increased paid expenses, followed by expected higher applied interest rates. Additionally, the company's intangible assets of $5,616 mm are expected to fully amortize their values in the next five years, which raises additional concerns about its long-term profitability. However, if any further due diligence is needed, it would be recommended to concentrate on evaluating each sub-segment's value, growth potential, and market viability. This conduct primarily addresses whether the liquidation value of any assets could potentially provide a safe haven for our invested capital, securing a proper Exit multiple in case of default.</p>

            <h2>Alternative Thesis</h2>
            <p>When such a high risk of the company’s default is asserted, there is significant pressure associated with Equity investment. Significant debt positions construct a hostile environment for equity investors and a higher risk of default on invested capital. At the current level of trailing, the company is going to face its default within the next five years according to both DCF analysis and situational basis. At a discount rate of 4% over a 5-year horizon, the NPV of enterprise value is $2,931 Mm, which remains below its current debt amount of $9,347 Mm, resulting in a projection of negative intrinsic equity value per share with the internal rate of return of -27%.</p>
            <p>However, with increasing forecasted demand in higher latency networks driven by accelerated commercialization of cloud computing and AI, the general industry trend is optimistic towards its future growth. If any further due diligence is needed, it would be recommended to concentrate on evaluating each sub-segment value, growth potential, and market viability, primarily addressing whether the liquidation value of any assets could potentially provide a safe haven for our invested capital, securing a proper Exit multiple in case of default. </p>
            <P>The current significant credit spread between the market borrowing rate and the expected applied interest rate on a firm with such a credit rating is notable as well. Currently, the C+ credit-rated firm’s cost of borrowed capital is in the range of 13 to 15 percent, and for the current case, the expected applied interest rate is about 17 to 18 percent. Thus, such a senior secured term loan backed by proper collateral to preserve the amount of initial invested capital will sufficiently generate about a 10 to 13 percent rate of return premium.</P>
